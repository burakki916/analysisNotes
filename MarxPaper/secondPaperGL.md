Your paper is supposed to be an interpretation of some aspect of the work(s): in other words, an argument concerning some aspect of the work based on analysis of relevant textual evidence.  Your paper is not supposed to be a summary of the work, a statement of your opinion about the work, or a discussion of its historical significance or relevance.

Frame your paper as an investigation of why and how the author makes the argument he or she does rather than simply saying what is said.  Turn your topic into an argument.

Give a clear statement of your argument at the beginning of your paper.

Unify your paper with a single argument and a logical development of that argument from one step to the next.  Do not make your paper a collection of separate points or examples.

Every time you claim that the author states or argues something, you should have evidence to support your statement, either in the form of a quotation or a citation/reference to a specific part of the text.

Use clear and simple language, but a formal style. You are writing a formal paper, not an email message.  Avoid colloquial or chatty language.  Do not use contractions: not using them reminds you of the appropriate level of discourse for your paper.  Obscurity is not profundity.  Make sure that you know the meaning of the words you use.  Make sure that the concepts and terms you use in analyzing the work are historically appropriate.

# Critera for assesment
Do you have a clear statement of your argument?
Do you provide relevant evidence?
Are your reasoning and writing clear and effective?
Do you demonstrate understanding of the work(s) you are analyzing?
To what degree do you address the most important questions and problems posed by the work(s) you are interpreting?

# Dont make it a summary 
 If your paper is effectively a summary of the work rather than an interpretation of it, then the best grade you can possibly receive is a C- (70).  If your paper is a statement of your personal opinion about the work or a discussion of its applicability or relevance, then the best grade you can possibly receive is a D (65).
