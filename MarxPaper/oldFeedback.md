"This conclusion mostly summarizes stuff you’ve already said. Overall, there are some good things to work with in this paper. The main weakness of the paper is that it makes a series of disparate points about the Prince. The exercise is to make an argument supporting the conclusion that NM is/is not best thought of as a teacher of evil. If you’re arguing he is not but rather best understood as a pragmatist whose supposedly evil advice in fact redounds to the people, that’s fine. But you need to build that case systematically and in a way that uses NM’s words to justify that point of view. Explain why NM takes this more realistic perspective. And then use an example to illustrate how his more realistic approach yields more for the people than the supposedly more “virtuous” alternative. There are other things to improve upon, especially the use of textual evidence. But having a clear argument that forms the organizing principle of the paper will get you a long way toward a much stronger paper. (Note: this paper also doesn’t reach the minimum page length.)"
